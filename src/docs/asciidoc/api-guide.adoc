[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

Menu Generation RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

Menu Generation RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's `Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-headers]]
== Headers

Every response has the following header(s), if relevant:

include::{snippets}/headers-example/response-headers.adoc[]

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object that describes the
problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to create an ingredient with an already used name will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[errors-list]]
=== Errors list

Here is the list of all error codes that an error response can reference

include::{snippets}/errors-list/errors.adoc[]

[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

Menu Generation RESTful API uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format.
Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate.
